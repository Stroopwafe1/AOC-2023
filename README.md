# AOC-2023 in Forest!!! (My programming language)

This year I am trying to do Advent of Code in my own programming language. Reason for this is to easily discover things I want to add to it and also learn more about low level CPU stuff.

## Requirements
- My programming language compiler [Forest](https://github.com/Stroopwafe1/Forest)

## Steps to run

```bash
$ cd 01
$ Forest .
$ ./build/main example.txt OR ./build/main input.txt
```
